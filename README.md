# Container Template

(Feel free to remove this file in your final repo)

This is a template for packer to build and package a container for our local
registry.  You'll need to edit both files, and replace `containername` with the
name of the final container.

This uses Packer, and the drone exec pipeline, so it runs directly on the build
host.
